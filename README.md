## Atomic Multiplets

Calculate term symbols given occupations in two angular momentum shells.
How to do this is nicely described in Inka Locht's PhD thesis, see link [here](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1050660&dswid=main "Inka Locht PhD thesis").
Hund's rule ground state can also be calculated.
Using dipole selection rule $\Delta J = 0,\pm 1$, the number of possible transitions from Hund's ground state to core-excited states are calulated.
